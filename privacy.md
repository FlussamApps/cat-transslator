Effective Date: July 25, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Cat Translator" Alexa skill ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our skill. Your use of the skill signifies your acceptance of this policy.

1. Information We Collect

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our skill is designed to function without collecting any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, or location.

The information we process includes:

Voice Input: When you interact with the skill, you provide voice commands. This includes descriptions of your cat's behavior (e.g., "my cat is meowing at the door"), your choice of cat personality (e.g., "royal"), and requests for cat facts or language changes. This input is processed by Amazon's Alexa service and sent to our backend to fulfill your request.
Session Attributes: To provide a continuous experience within a single session, we temporarily store your chosen language and cat personality. This information is discarded as soon as your session with the skill ends.
User Locale: We receive your device's locale setting (e.g., 'en-US', 'es-ES') from the Alexa service to set the initial language of the skill.


2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information solely for the purpose of operating and improving the Cat Translator skill. This includes:

Generating Translations: Your description of your cat's behavior is sent to a third-party AI service (OpenAI) to generate a humorous translation.
Personalizing Responses: The chosen personality is used to tailor the AI-generated response to be more entertaining.
Providing Responses in Your Language: Your language preference is used to deliver all interactions in the correct language.
Fulfilling Requests: To provide you with cat facts or change skill settings as you request.



3. Third-Party Services & Data Sharing

To provide the core translation and fact-generation features, we use the OpenAI API.

When you ask for a translation or a cat fact, a constructed prompt (which includes the cat's behavior, chosen personality, and language instruction) is sent to the OpenAI API.
Your interaction with OpenAI is subject to their privacy policy, which you can review here: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

We do not share any data with any other third parties.


4. Data Security and Retention

We do not store any of your voice inputs or personal data on our servers. Information is processed in real-time to generate a response and is not retained by us after the interaction is complete. Session data is automatically deleted when your session with the skill ends.

Please note that Amazon handles your voice recordings according to its own privacy policy.


5. Children's Privacy

The Cat Translator skill is not intended for or directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
